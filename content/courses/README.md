# Secondary School Programming Curriculum

Welcome to the DataDruid Labs learning track for secondary school students. This curriculum focuses on building strong Python fundamentals through hands-on projects and also introduces JavaScript and SQL basics.

## Python Track
Learn core concepts and build real applications:

- [`number_guessing_game.ipynb`](python/number_guessing_game.ipynb) – classic high/low game.
- [`mad_libs_story.ipynb`](python/mad_libs_story.ipynb) – create a silly story from user input.
- [`magic_8_ball.ipynb`](python/magic_8_ball.ipynb) – fortune-telling toy simulation.
- [`area_calculator.ipynb`](python/area_calculator.ipynb) – compute area for shapes.
- [`todo_list.ipynb`](python/todo_list.ipynb) – manage tasks in a list.
- [`quiz_program.ipynb`](python/quiz_program.ipynb) – ask questions and score answers.
- [`text_adventure.ipynb`](python/text_adventure.ipynb) – mini interactive story.
- [`data_analysis.ipynb`](python/data_analysis.ipynb) – explore data with pandas.
- [`password_generator.ipynb`](python/password_generator.ipynb) – create secure passwords.

## JavaScript Track
Start experimenting with dynamic web programming:

- [`click_counter.ipynb`](javascript/click_counter.ipynb) – interactive button updates on each click.

## SQL Track
Use SQL to query structured data:

- [`basic_queries.ipynb`](sql/basic_queries.ipynb) – create tables and run simple queries with SQLite.

Each notebook contains guided code cells and can be run directly in the browser. Students are encouraged to experiment, modify the examples, and document their learning.
