# Module 5: Version Control with Git
## Lesson 1: What is Version Control?

Welcome to a crucial tool for any developer, data scientist, or anyone who works with code: **Version Control**.

### The Problem: "Final_Report_v3_final_final_real_one.docx"

Have you ever had a folder that looks like this?

- `MyProject/`
  - `script.py`
  - `script_v2.py`
  - `script_v2_backup.py`
  - `script_v3_broken.py`
  - `script_v4_works.py`

This is a common but messy way to keep track of changes. It's hard to know which is the latest version, what changes were made in each file, and it makes collaborating with others nearly impossible.

### The Solution: Version Control Systems (VCS)

A Version Control System is software that helps you track changes to your files over time. It's like a time machine for your code. You can:

- **See the entire history** of your project.
- **Revert back** to a previous version at any time.
- **Understand what changed** between versions.
- **Collaborate** with others on the same project without overwriting each other's work.

### What is Git?

**Git** is the most popular Version Control System in the world. It's a free, open-source tool that is fast, efficient, and used by individuals and companies of all sizes.

**GitHub**, **GitLab**, and **Bitbucket** are popular websites that provide hosting for Git repositories, making it easy to store your code online and collaborate with others.

### Why is this "Job Ready"?

- **Collaboration:** Almost every software development or data science team uses Git to work together.
- **Safety Net:** Git allows you to experiment and make changes without fear of permanently breaking your project. You can always go back.
- **Showcasing Your Work:** A GitHub profile with your projects is like a portfolio for a programmer. It's a great way to show your skills to potential employers.

In the next lessons, we'll learn the basic Git commands you'll use every day.
