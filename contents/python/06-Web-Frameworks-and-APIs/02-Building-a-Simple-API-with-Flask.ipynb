    "\n",
    "**Note:** Because we are in a special JupyterLite environment, running a web server directly from a notebook can be tricky. This lesson focuses on understanding the code. To run this yourself, you would save it as a `.py` file on your own computer (if you have Python installed) and run `python app.py` from your terminal."

    "2.  **`app = Flask(__name__)`**: We create our web application instance.\n",
    "3.  **`@app.route('/')`**: This is a Python **decorator**. It's a special syntax that adds functionality to the function below it. This one ties the `home()` function to the root URL (`/`) of our website.\n",
    "4.  **`@app.route('/api/hello')`**: We define a second route. If you were running this server and went to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/hello` in your browser, you would see the JSON data.\n",
    "5.  **`jsonify(data)`**: This function from Flask correctly formats our Python dictionary into a JSON response that browsers and other applications can understand.\n",
    "6.  **`if __name__ == '__main__':`**: This is a standard Python construct. It ensures that the code inside it only runs when the file is executed as the main program."
