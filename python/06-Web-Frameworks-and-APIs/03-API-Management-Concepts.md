# Lesson 3: API Management Concepts

Building an API is one thing, but using them in the real world involves a few more concepts. When you use a professional API (like one from Google Maps, X/Twitter, or OpenAI), you'll encounter these ideas.

### 1. API Keys

An **API Key** is a unique string of characters that is used to identify and authenticate you when you make a request to an API.

**Why are they used?**
-   **Identification:** The API provider knows who is using their service.
-   **Security:** It prevents unauthorized users from accessing the API.
-   **Analytics:** The provider can track how much you use the API.

You should **always keep your API keys secret!** If you expose your key (for example, by committing it to a public GitHub repository), someone else could use it and you might be charged for their usage.

### 2. Rate Limiting

Most APIs have **rate limits**. This is a limit on how many requests you can make in a certain amount of time. For example, an API might have a rate limit of 100 requests per minute.

**Why is it used?**
-   **Fair Usage:** It ensures that no single user can overwhelm the API server, slowing it down for everyone else.
-   **Security:** It helps prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
-   **Business Model:** API providers often offer different rate limits for different pricing tiers.

If you exceed the rate limit, the API will usually send back a special error response with a status code of `429 Too Many Requests`.

### 3. API Documentation

Every good API comes with **documentation**. This is a website or a set of documents that explains:
-   What **endpoints** (URLs) are available.
-   What **parameters** each endpoint accepts.
-   What the **format of the response** will be.
-   How to **authenticate** (e.g., how to use your API key).
-   What the **rate limits** are.

Before you can use a new API, you must **read the documentation**. It's the instruction manual for the API.

This concludes our module on Web Frameworks and APIs. In the next module, we will put this all together to build a project that uses a real-world AI API!
